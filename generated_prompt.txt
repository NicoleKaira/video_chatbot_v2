For example, you may be implementing your algorithm on a device with limited memory.\n(05:22.04) In such cases, you may not be able to use an algorithm that requires a large space complexity."), Document(metadata={'video_id': 'tg2fy923h1', 'start': '0:05:36.4', 'end': '0:07:43.84'}, page_content="[Video title] Lecture2_Sc1007\n[Tags] Beginning\n[Visual labels] human face, person\n[OCR] ge, Analysis of Algorithms, TER SCIEN, OF,  The study of the efficiency and performance of algorithms,  Evaluate the speed and scalability of an algorithm,  How its efficiency changes as input sizes grow,  Identify the most efficient algorithms for a given problem,  Understand the trade-offs between different approaches, SPINE LEVEL, Dntu.edu.sg) Loke Yuan Ren (yrloke, Time and space complexities,  Analyze efficiency of an algorithm in two aspects,  Time complexity: the amount of time used by an algorithm, .

Count the number of primitive operations in the algorithm\n[Transcript] (05:37.64) Instead, you would choose one that uses less memory.\n(05:41.92) However, sometimes you want your algorithm to run as fast as possible, which is often the case.\n(05:45.64) In such situations, you would choose the one with the lowest order of growth in time complexity to solve the problem.\n(06:01.20) So, it depends on your resources when deciding which algorithm to implement for a particular problem.\n(06:12.84) In short, we will discuss two complexities: time complexity and space complexity.\n(06:20.76) I will mainly focus on time complexity because once you know how to analyze it, you can use a similar approach to evaluate the amount of memory needed by an algorithm.\n(06:38.12) Time complexity measures the amount of time used by an algorithm. How do we measure this time?\n(06:48.60) We don't actually run the program to test how long it takes because that would be unfair; different computers have different computational powers.\n(07:00.36) If you use a supercomputer, it will run much faster than your home or laptop computer.\n(07:09.80) So, that is not a fair approach to measure time complexity.\n(07:18.88) Instead, we try to count the number of primitive operations in the algorithm.\n(07:28.72) What are primitive operations?\n(07:31.72) They can include declaring variables, which takes some time.\n(07:37.84) We need to know how many such operations are performed in the algorithm."), Document(metadata={}, page_content="[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] (57:14.44) This is what you will learn in the next few weeks.\n(57:20.60) Before I end today's lecture, I want to let you know that this Wednesday, I will cover the analysis of algorithms.\n(57:39.08) I will introduce time complexity and space complexity, discussing best case, worst case, average efficiency, and why you need to know the order of growth of an algorithm and how to represent them, such as using big O notation."), Document(metadata={}, page_content="[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] Beginning\n[OCR] Data Structures and, Algorithms, ge, Best, Science, Dr. Loke Yuan Ren, College of Engineering, School of Computer Science and Engineering, OF, ER SCIE, len (yrloke@ntu.edu.sg) Loke Yuan, Data, ER SCIEN, analysis, N4-02, In, N4-02B-69A, Introduction\n[Transcript] (00:10.56) Hi.\n(00:11.60) Can you all hear me?\n(00:12.36) Hi, can you all hear me?\n(00:37.53) I think you all can hear me, but there's a delay of five to six seconds.\n(00:47.25) So today I'll give an introduction to the algorithm and analysis of algorithms through this channel.\n(00:57.96) In the second half, I will continue my lecture through this channel.\n(01:01.44) After the lecture, the video will automatically be added to the playlist.\n(01:08.88) You should be able to find all the videos.\n(01:12.60) I will also keep last year's videos.\n(01:18.04) However, every time I teach, I cover different parts.\n(01:20.12) So, yes, you will notice that.\n(01:23.08) Every time I give my lecture, it's a live stream, so it will be slightly different each time.\n(01:30.20) I have already uploaded the notes.\n(01:33.68) If I miss anything, you can refer to the lecture notes.\n(01:37.48) Everything I want to say is available in the notes.\n(01:43.20) You can refer to the notes and the slides.\n(01:46.32) I will upload more in the coming week, either this week or during the recess week.\n(01:53.44) So, what I will do today is give the lecture.\n(01:56.92) If you have any questions, you can post them in the chat, but I may not be able to answer immediately because there's a delay of about five to six seconds.\n(02:10.32) Based on my observation, it should be five to six seconds.\n(02:15.16) I will try to answer your questions at the end of the lecture.\n(02:20.04) Please post them in the chat; I think that will be easier for me.\n(02:24.76) OK, so let us start the lecture.\n(02:30.40) This is my name, my email address, and my office.\n(02:34.96) If you have any questions, you can drop me an email.\n(02:40.76) First, I will give the lecture about the algorithm."), Document(metadata={}, page_content='[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] Beginning\n[OCR] Algorithms, ge, OF, ER SCIE, Introduction, programming, ntu.edu.sg) Loke Yuan Ren (yrloke, Computer Science Programme Structure, SC1003, MH1810, SC1015, Discrete, Introduction to Data, Introduction to, Mathematics, Science & Artificial, Computational, Intelligence, Thinking &, Digital Logic, Computer, SC2000, Data Structures &, Organisation &, Probability, Linear Algebra, Statistic for, Architecture, for Computing, Computing, SC2207, Object Oriented, Algorithm Design, Operating, Software, & Analysis, Systems, Computing Networks, to Databases, Design &, Engineering, Artificial, Database System, Advanced, Principles, Security, Computer Networks, SC2001, TER SCIEN\n[Transcript] (13:18.40) However, you should expect that in the next level, they will expect you to know how to select the most efficient algorithm.\n(13:24.44) The more important concern is whether you know which algorithm is the most efficient.
