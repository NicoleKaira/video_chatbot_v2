I always follow the same procedure, and I can find the answer instantly.\n(26:21.20) But if you consider the other two, the number of iterations grows larger and larger.\n(26:26.32) Then my for loop needs to run more iterations, or my recursive function requires more and more recursive calls.\n(26:33.52) So that is the problem we need to discuss this week about the analysis of algorithms.\n(26:40.56) How do you know if this algorithm is good or if that algorithm is not good?\n(26:45.56) Now, how do you define a good or bad algorithm?\n(26:49.72) We will discuss this week.",
