        "answer": "Some algorithm design strategies mentioned in the video include:\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer**: This strategy involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining their solutions. An example given is visiting all nodes in a binary tree by dividing the task into left and right subtrees. Covered at **(10:00)**.\n\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: This approach involves making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. It is characterized by choosing the best option available at the moment without considering the overall problem. Covered at **(10:00)**.\n\n3. **Decrease and Conquer**: This strategy is similar to divide and conquer but focuses on reducing the problem size by a constant factor rather than dividing it into multiple parts. An example provided is binary search. Covered at **(10:00)**.\n\n4. **Transform and Conquer**: This involves transforming the input into a different format to make the problem easier to solve, which can lead to improved efficiency. An example discussed is converting mathematical expressions from infix to prefix notation.
