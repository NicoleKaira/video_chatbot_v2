They stress that understanding the implementation of solutions is crucial, as simply knowing the solution does not provide insight into how it was derived. The speaker encourages attendees to practice coding themselves to truly learn the material. This point is highlighted when they say, \"you should learn. It's like not read the solution and you yourself trying to implement it\" and concludes with a thank you and goodbye. This is covered at [mm:ss] towards the end of the transcript.",
