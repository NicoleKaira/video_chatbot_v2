        "answer": "The definition of an algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, which produces a required output for any legitimate input in a finite amount of time. This means that given a specific input, the algorithm will consistently yield the same output. This definition is supported by various sources, including \"Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms\" by Anany Levitin, which emphasizes that an algorithm must be well-defined and systematic, ensuring that every step is clear and precise without any ambiguity. \n\nThis concept is further elaborated with the three key components of an algorithm: correctness, precision, and finiteness. Correctness ensures that the output is accurate and consistent for every input, precision requires that all steps are clearly defined, and finiteness means that the algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps. \n\nThese points are covered at the following timestamps: \n- Definition of an algorithm: Covered at **17:00**\n- Key components of an algorithm: Covered at **19:14** and **20:56**.",
