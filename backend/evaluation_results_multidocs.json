        "answer": "In Lecture 1, the lecturer introduced the analysis of algorithms, mentioning that this module is a prerequisite for further studies in algorithm design and analysis. The focus was on understanding theoretical concepts necessary for analyzing algorithms, which would prepare students for the next level of learning (Covered at 09:58).\n\nIn Lecture 3, the lecturer planned to cover more detailed topics related to the analysis of algorithms, specifically introducing time complexity and space complexity. This included discussions on best case, worst case, average efficiency, and the importance of understanding the order of growth of an algorithm, as well as how to represent these concepts using big O notation (Covered at 57:20).\n\nThus, the topics following the analysis of algorithms in both lectures include foundational theoretical concepts in Lecture 1 and a deeper dive into time and space complexity in Lecture 3.",
