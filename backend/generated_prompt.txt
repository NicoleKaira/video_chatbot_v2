    You are an AI assistant that answers questions based on detailed video context. The context includes:

    - **Transcripts** with timestamps quoted by "(" and ")".
    
    **Instructions:**
    
    1. **Understand the User's Question:**
       - Carefully read the user's query to determine what information they are seeking.
    
    2. **Use Relevant Context:**
       - Search through the provided context to find information that directly answers the question.
       - Reference specific timestamps (in **mm:ss** format) when mentioning parts of the video.
       - For every important information, I want you to quote the timestamp in this format ONLY: "Covered at [mm:ss]"
    
    3. **Compose a Clear and Concise Answer:**
       - Provide the information in a straightforward manner.
       - Ensure the response is self-contained and understandable without needing additional information.
       - If unsure of question, ask the user to clarify again in a polite manner.
       - If unable to find answer in context, say that you are unable to find an answer in a polite manner.
    
    4. **Formatting Guidelines:**
       - Begin your answer by addressing the user's question.

You did five calls, and this is just for N equal to 4.\n(30:16.32) If N is larger, you will notice that you repeatedly call the same input and run the same code multiple times.\n(30:27.88) The larger the number, the more calls you will have.\n(30:32.52) So this is actually out of the scope of this module, but just for your information, the time complexity is approximately 1.6 raised to the power of N.\n(30:59.52) The complexity is sometimes referred to as 2 raised to the power of N.\n(31:08.12) Yes, it's exponential.\n(31:09.48) You will find that it actually takes a long time.\n(31:11.64) In fact, you can try to implement this algorithm with N equal to 100, and you'll be surprised at how long it takes, even with a very good computer.\n(31:24.56) This will take much longer compared to the iterative way, because in the iterative approach, you just run N iterations.\n(31:33.36) Moreover, algorithm 5 is still not the best algorithm.\n(31:39.32) There's another algorithm I will not discuss here, but you can find one that can achieve logarithmic time complexity.\n(31:56.88) This one is linear because you have N iterations.\n(32:04.60) However, if you observe carefully, you will see that you still repeatedly do some calculations in every iteration.\n(32:08.24) So there is a more optimal way that achieves logarithmic time complexity.\n(32:14.28) There are many algorithms you can choose to solve a problem, but we need to analyze the solutions and determine which one gives us the most efficient way to solve it, and then we implement that one."), Document(metadata={'video_id': 'zwb6lqhpzl', 'start': '0:32:32.12', 'end': '0:35:14.88'}, page_content="[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] Middle\n[Transcript] (32:32.60) Normally, we don't brute force to try everything; we simply implement whatever we think works and find it inappropriate. When the problem becomes more complicated, you will waste a lot of time implementing inefficient algorithms and realize that they don't work well.\n(32:51.72) Then you need to find another one.\n(32:53.36) So sometimes people analyze and find out which one is the best.\n(32:57.20) Then they implement that one, which is good enough.\n(33:03.16) So actually, in this case, algorithm 5 is fine, but there's another one you can find on your own that can achieve logarithmic time complexity.\n(33:19.44) So, back to the earlier algorithms, there are many kinds of problems in this module. We discussed searching, graph problems, and some combinatorial problems, meaning permutation and combination problems.\n(33:38.08) In the next level, they will discuss sorting strings, processing, and some mathematics courses.\n(33:46.40) They will teach you geometric and numerical problems.\n(33:49.68) I will briefly introduce these in the next few slides.\n(33:54.24) Searching is the most intuitive one you have learned in English.\n(33:58.48) In fact, I think anyone should know this; it's common sense.\n(34:02.56) You have a sequence of numbers that are not stored in order, and you want to search whether a key is inside the sequence or not.\n(34:09.12) There is no other way; you have to check every single one, and such a search is called a linear search.\n(34:27.44) You return, and sometimes you're lucky; the first item is the one you search for, and you just need one step. But sometimes you may need to run through all of them.\n(34:40.04) The worst case is that you find none of them is the key, and then you can't find the key.\n(34:47.56) Overall, you'll find that this is what is called linear search.\n(34:53.08) It will take linear time to search.\n(34:56.32) In week 8, I will cover another way to store the data.\n(35:00.84) If you have a smart way to store the data in a certain form, like a hash table.\n(35:06.48) Every time before you store the data, you have a unique function, a hash function, to map it to a certain index."), Document(metadata={}, page_content="[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] End\n[Transcript] (57:14.44) This is what you will learn in the next few weeks.\n(57:20.60) Before I end today's lecture, I want to let you know that this Wednesday, I will cover the analysis of algorithms.\n(57:39.08) I will introduce time complexity and space complexity, discussing best case, worst case, average efficiency, and why you need to know the order of growth of an algorithm and how to represent them, such as using big O notation."), Document(metadata={}, page_content="[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] Beginning\n[OCR] Data Structures and, Algorithms, ge, Best, Science, Dr. Loke Yuan Ren, College of Engineering, School of Computer Science and Engineering, OF, ER SCIE, len (yrloke@ntu.edu.sg) Loke Yuan, Data, ER SCIEN, analysis, N4-02, In, N4-02B-69A, Introduction\n[Transcript] (00:10.56) Hi.\n(00:11.60) Can you all hear me?\n(00:12.36) Hi, can you all hear me?\n(00:37.53) I think you all can hear me, but there's a delay of five to six seconds.\n(00:47.25) So today I'll give an introduction to the algorithm and analysis of algorithms through this channel.\n(00:57.96) In the second half, I will continue my lecture through this channel.\n(01:01.44) After the lecture, the video will automatically be added to the playlist.\n(01:08.88) You should be able to find all the videos.\n(01:12.60) I will also keep last year's videos.\n(01:18.04) However, every time I teach, I cover different parts.\n(01:20.12) So, yes, you will notice that.\n(01:23.08) Every time I give my lecture, it's a live stream, so it will be slightly different each time.\n(01:30.20) I have already uploaded the notes.\n(01:33.68) If I miss anything, you can refer to the lecture notes.\n(01:37.48) Everything I want to say is available in the notes.\n(01:43.20) You can refer to the notes and the slides.\n(01:46.32) I will upload more in the coming week, either this week or during the recess week.\n(01:53.44) So, what I will do today is give the lecture.\n(01:56.92) If you have any questions, you can post them in the chat, but I may not be able to answer immediately because there's a delay of about five to six seconds.\n(02:10.32) Based on my observation, it should be five to six seconds.\n(02:15.16) I will try to answer your questions at the end of the lecture.\n(02:20.04) Please post them in the chat; I think that will be easier for me.\n(02:24.76) OK, so let us start the lecture.\n(02:30.40) This is my name, my email address, and my office.\n(02:34.96) If you have any questions, you can drop me an email.\n(02:40.76) First, I will give the lecture about the algorithm."), Document(metadata={}, page_content='[Video title] Sc1007_videolecture\n[Tags] Beginning\n[OCR] 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 40%, 20%, ge, OF, ER SCIEN, Week, Lecture Topic, Tutorial, Lab, Assignment Deadline, Introduction to Data Structure, Introduction Linked List (LL), Linked List (LL) - Linear Search, T1 (LL), Stack and Queue (SQ) - Arithmetic Operations, Makeup T1(LL), Lab 1 (LL), Binary Trees (BT) and Binary Search Trees, T2 (SQ), Lab 2 (SQ), AS1: LL (10/02/2023), Binary Trees - Binary Search and AVL Trees, Lab 3 (BT), AS2: SQ (17/02/2023), Analysis of Algorithm (AA), T3 (BT & BST), Lab 4 (BST), AS3: BT (24/02/2023), Lab Test 1 (Recess Week: 02/03/2023), Hash Table, T4 (AA), Basic Graph (G), Lab 5 (Hash Table), T5 (Hash Table), Lab 6 (Graph), AS4: Hash Table, Dynamic Programming, AS6: Permutation/ Matching, T6 (Graph), Lab 8 (DP), AS5: Graph, Revision, Makeup Lab 8, Lab Test 2 + Quiz (20/04/2023), AFS + backtracking/ Permutation, Learning Outcomes, 1.
